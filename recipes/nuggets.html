        <h2>Crispy, golden chicken nuggets with tender, juicy meat inside—perfect for dipping and snacking.</h2>
        <p>Chicken nuggets are bite-sized pieces of chicken coated in a seasoned breading and fried or baked until golden and crunchy. They're easy to make at home with simple ingredients and taste far better than store-bought. Perfect for kids, parties, or a quick meal.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs (cut into chunks)</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
            <li>1 cup breadcrumbs or panko</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp pepper</li>
            <li>½ tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
            <li>Oil for frying (or spray for baking/air frying)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut chicken breasts or thighs into bite-sized chunks. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder if desired.</li>
            <li>Set up a breading station with three bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs or panko.</li>
            <li>Dredge each chicken piece in flour, dip in the egg, then coat in breadcrumbs. Press lightly to help the crumbs stick.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry nuggets in batches for 3–4 minutes per side until golden and fully cooked. Alternatively, bake at 400°F (200°C) for 18–20 minutes or air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 12–15 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels and serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
