        <h2>Crispy, golden hash browns made from shredded potatoes, cooked to perfection in a skillet.</h2>
        <p>Hash browns are a breakfast favorite, made by shredding potatoes, squeezing out the moisture, and frying them in oil or butter until crispy and golden on both sides.</p>
        <p>Simple, satisfying, and delicious, they’re perfect on their own or as a side to eggs and bacon.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>2–3 tablespoons oil or butter</li>
            <li>Optional: 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by peeling and shredding russet potatoes. Rinse the shreds under cold water to remove excess starch, then squeeze them dry using a clean towel or cheesecloth—removing moisture is key to crispiness.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dried potatoes to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Optional: mix in a bit of finely chopped onion for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Heat a generous layer of oil or butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes in a thin, even layer. Press them down with a spatula and cook undisturbed for 5–7 minutes until golden and crisp on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Flip in sections or as one piece, then cook the other side for another 5–7 minutes until equally crispy. Drain briefly on paper towels and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
